<h1> Welcome to RotavirusPred</h1>
<p>A webserver to predict hosts of Rotavirus A</p>
<p>FluSPred(Flu Spread Prediction) is a machine learning based tool to predict the zoonotic host tropism of the Influenza A virus with the help of its protein and genome sequences, stating whether a viral strain has the potential to infect human hosts. This was developed to help prioritize high-risk viral strains for future research, aid the study of emergence or the risk a novel influenza virus possesses if it acquires the capability to spread human to human.

    FluSPred will be able to take a query sequence or a set of sequences of Influenza A proteins and genomes in .fasta format, and the respective model has to be selected by the user. The model will predict the zoonotic host, stating if it will infect humans or not, in the form of an output file in .csv format.</p>
